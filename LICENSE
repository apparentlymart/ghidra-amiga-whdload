The Amiga Hunk loader by Vladimir Kononovich was invaluable as a practical
example of how to build a Ghidra loader and type implementations. The WHDLoad
loader does not directly include any code from the Amiga Hunk Loader, but the
author would like to thank Vladimir Kononovich for the inspiration and for
a good, straightforward example of using the Ghidra API.
